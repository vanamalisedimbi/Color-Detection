Color Detection using python.

**THIS IS THE NEW VERSION, WITH BETTER ACCURACY AND USES pygame INSTEAD.**

The python file is a model that will take an image from the user, and can 'pick' the colour that
the mouse is pointing at.

Running the files:
1. Run the .py file: 
        This will create an ML model using the training data present in the colors.csv file.
     **MAKE SURE THE NAMES ARE CORRECT**

2. Upon running the file the code will ask you for the path of the image to be assessed.

3. Providing a valid image will lead to it being opened in an individual window.

4. Hovering over any colour and holding down the 'c' key will display colour information.

5. It will be displayed even while the cursor is moving as long as the 'c' key is held down.


Thank you.
